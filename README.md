# STM32_F3

This is a work in progress project.

The project uses STM32F303 Discovery board to implement various drivers like UART, SPI, I2C and CAN without using any pre-existing libraries.

Keil uVision 5 IDE is used to code and debug, header file provided by ST.

The main goal is to introduce students to ARM Cortex-M4 based MCUs. 

This project counts toward an internship under Prof.Mahesh Warang, KJSCE, Mumbai

Video tutorials to be added in future
